I am Tianyu Chen, a 5th-year PhD student at Beihang University, where I have the privilege of being mentored by professor [Jianxin Li](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/lijianxin/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Haoyi Zhou](https://www.zhouhaoyi.com/). My academic journey began at Beihang University, where I earned my bachelor's degree in 2020, setting the foundation for my pursuit of knowledge.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to contribute as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia under the guidance of [Shaohan Huang](https://buaahsh.github.io/), further enriching my experience and skills. Beyond academia, I am also a co-founder of [SeekThought](https://www.seekthought.com/) (backed by YC China in Spring 2022), where we strive to bridge the gap between research and practical applications.

Highlights
======

My current focus is on **AI4Science** and **Trustworthy Foundation Models**, two fields that promise to revolutionize scientific discovery. I am actively **seeking postdoctoral positions or full-time research roles in these domains**, eager to contribute my expertise and passion towards advancing our understanding of the universe through artificial intelligence.
